## Project Description

This project came out of the `Machine Learning Crash Course`: [Linear Regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression)

The goal of the project is to take a real dataset to train a model to predict the fare of a taxi ride in Chicago, Illinois.

### What this Project Does Specifically

The project:

- Loads and inspects the taxi cab data
- Preprocesses/cleans the data
- Performs exploratory data analysis
- Creates a Deep Learning Keras built neural network to build the prediction model
- Conducts analysis of the predictive model results
- Makes any improvements

---

## Objective

The project contains the key elements:

- `Deep Learning` for neural networks building,
- `Git` (version control),
- `Jupyter` Python coded notebooks,
- `Keras` to build nodes and layers,
- `Matplotlib` visualization of spaces,
- `Numpy` for arrays and numerical operations,
- `Pandas` for dataframe usage,
- `Plotly` for visualization,
- `Python` the standard modules,
- `TensorFlow` to build nodes and layers,
- `Type` hinting using `Pylance`, and
- `uv` package management including use of `ruff` for linting and formatting

## Getting Started

Here are some instructions to help you set up this project locally.

---

## Installation Steps

The Python version used for this project is `Python 3.11` to be compatible with TensorFlow.

Follow the requirements for using TensorFlow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#macos)

use `uv pip install tensorflow`

- Make sure to use python versions `Python 3.9‚Äì3.12
- pip version 19.0 or higher for Linux (requires manylinux2014 support) and Windows. pip version 20.3 or higher for macOS.
- Windows Native Requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019

### Clone the Repo

1. Clone the repo (or download it as a zip file):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beenlanced/ml_predict_taxi_fares.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using `uv` Python version 3.11:

   ```bash
   uv venv --python=3.11
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment: `.venv`

   On macOs and Linux:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate #mac
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bash
    # In cmd.exe
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

4. Install packages using `pyproject.toml` or (see special notes section)

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
   ```
